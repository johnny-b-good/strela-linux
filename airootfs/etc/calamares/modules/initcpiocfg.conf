# Modifications to the standard list of hooks.
#
# There are three subkeys:
# - prepend, which puts hooks at the beginning of the
#   list of hooks, in the order specified here,
# - append, which adds hooks at the end of the list of
#   hooks, in the order specified here,
# - remove, which removes hooks from the list of hooks,
#   wherever they may be.
#
# The example configuration here yields bogus, <stuff>, bogus
# initially, and then removes that hook again.
#
hooks:
    prepend: [ bogus ]
    append: [ bogus ]
    remove: [ bogus ]

# In some cases, you may want to use a different source
# file than /etc/mkinitcpio.conf , e.g. because the live system
# does not match the target in a useful way. If unset or
# empty, defaults to /etc/mkinitcpio.conf

source: "/etc/mkinitcpio.conf"
